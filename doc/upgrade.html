<h1>runit - upgrading from previous versions</h1>
<hr>
<h3>1.1.0 to 1.2.0 or 1.2.1</h3>
With this version the <a href="runsv.8.html">runsv</a> program makes
controlling the service through commands normally sent by
<a href="runsvctrl.8.html">runsvctrl</a> configurable;
arbitrary actions through external programs can optionally be specified, and
signalling of the service disabled if desired.
See the <a href="runsv.8.html">man page</a> for details.
<p>
<a href="runsv.8.html">runsv</a> now reports the seconds since <tt>./run</tt>
has been started when running the <tt>./finish</tt> script, instead of the
seconds since <tt>./finish</tt> has been started.
It no longer reports immediately failing <tt>./run</tt> scripts as ``running''
for up to one second, but as ``down, normally up, want up''.
<h3>1.0.x to 1.1.0</h3>
The <a href="svlogd.8.html">svlogd</a> program now interprets the ``e'' and
``E'' configuration options so that they can be combined to select or
deselect log messages to be written to standard error, similar to the ``+''
and ``-'' options for the rotated log.
It also provides the new ``t'' and ``N'' configuration options, see the
<a href="svlogd.8.html">man page</a> for details.
The <a href="chpst.8.html">chpst</a> program supports adjusting the nice
level through the new -n command line option.
<p>
Starting with this version, <tt>/etc/runit/2</tt> by default runs the
<a href="runsvdir.8.html">runsvdir</a> program with the -P option.
To adapt edit <tt>/etc/runit/2</tt> and change the invocation of
<a href="runsvdir.8.html">runsvdir</a> accordingly, see
<a href="../etc/2"">here</a>.
