<h1>runit - upgrading from previous versions</h1>
<hr>
<h3>1.4.0 or 1.4.1 to 1.5.x</h3>
The <a href="svlogd.8.html">svlogd</a> program supports a new configuration
option p to optionally prefix each line written to logs, standard error, or
through UDP with a string, and no longer strips empty lines from the logs.
<h3>1.3.x to 1.4.0 or 1.4.1</h3>
With this version the <tt>runsvctrl</tt>, <tt>runsvstat</tt>,
<tt>svwaitdown</tt>, and <tt>svwaitup</tt> programs no longer are being
installed, the functionality of these programs has been incorporated into
the <a href="sv.8.html">sv</a> program.
The documentation now suggest to put service directories by default into
the <tt>/etc/sv/</tt> directory, and a list of frequently asked questions
with answers has been added.
The <a href="chpst.8.html">chpst</a> program understands a new option -d
to limit memory of the data segment per process.
<h3>1.2.x to 1.3.x</h3>
This release introduces a first test version of the <a href="sv.8.html">sv</a>
program, which can be used to control the state and query the status of
services monitored by <a href="runsv.8.html">runsv</a>.
Optionally it can be sym-linked into <tt>/etc/init.d/</tt> to provide an
interface to LSB init script actions for services controlled by runit.
See the <a href="sv.8.html">man page</a> for details.
Thanks to Lars Uffmann, instructions on how to run runit under launchd on
MacOSX 10.4 have been added.
<h3>1.1.0 to 1.2.x</h3>
With this version the <a href="runsv.8.html">runsv</a> program makes
controlling the service through commands normally sent by
<a href="runsvctrl.8.html">runsvctrl</a> configurable;
arbitrary actions through external programs can optionally be specified, and
signalling of the service disabled if desired.
See the <a href="runsv.8.html">man page</a> for details.
<p>
<a href="runsv.8.html">runsv</a> now reports the seconds since <tt>./run</tt>
has been started when running the <tt>./finish</tt> script, instead of the
seconds since <tt>./finish</tt> has been started.
It no longer reports immediately failing <tt>./run</tt> scripts as ``running''
for up to one second, but as ``down, normally up, want up''.
<h3>1.0.x to 1.1.0</h3>
The <a href="svlogd.8.html">svlogd</a> program now interprets the ``e'' and
``E'' configuration options so that they can be combined to select or
deselect log messages to be written to standard error, similar to the ``+''
and ``-'' options for the rotated log.
It also provides the new ``t'' and ``N'' configuration options, see the
<a href="svlogd.8.html">man page</a> for details.
The <a href="chpst.8.html">chpst</a> program supports adjusting the nice
level through the new -n command line option.
<p>
Starting with this version, <tt>/etc/runit/2</tt> by default runs the
<a href="runsvdir.8.html">runsvdir</a> program with the -P option.
To adapt edit <tt>/etc/runit/2</tt> and change the invocation of
<a href="runsvdir.8.html">runsvdir</a> accordingly, see
<a href="../etc/2"">here</a>.
