Description: a UNIX init scheme with service supervision
 runit is a replacement for SysV-init and other init schemes.  It runs on
 Debian GNU/Linux, *BSD, MacOSX, and Solaris, and may be easily adapted
 to other Unix operating systems.  runit implements a simple three-stage
 concept.  Stage 1 performs the system's one-time initialization tasks.
 Stage 2 starts the system's uptime services (via the runsvdir program).
 Stage 3 handles the tasks necessary to shutdown and halt or reboot.
 .
 The runit programs are compiled and linked statically with the diet libc
 on architectures the diet libc is available for.
 .
 See http://smarden.org/runit/ for more information.
 .
 This package does not replace the /sbin/init binary.  To do so you need
 to follow the documentation or install the runit-run package.
