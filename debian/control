Suggests: runit-run
Description: a UNIX init scheme with service supervision
 runit is a daemontools alike replacement for SysV-init and other init
 schemes. runit currently runs on Debian GNU/Linux, OpenBSD, FreeBSD,
 and may be easily adapted to other unix operating systems. runit
 implements a simple three-stage concept. Stage 1 performs the system's
 one-time initialization tasks. Stage 2 starts the system's uptime
 services (via the runsvdir program). Stage 3 handles the tasks necessary
 to shutdown and halt or reboot. 
 .
 See http://smarden.org/runit/ for more information.
 .
 This package does not replace the /sbin/init binary. To do so you need
 to follow the documentation or install the runit-run package.
