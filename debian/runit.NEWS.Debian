runit (1.4.1-1) unstable; urgency=low

    With this version the runsvctrl, runsvstat, svwaitdown, and svwaitup
    programs no longer are being installed, the functionality of these
    programs has been incorporated into the sv program.
    
    The documentation now suggest to put service directories by default
    into the /etc/sv/ directory, and a list of frequently asked questions
    with answers has been added.
